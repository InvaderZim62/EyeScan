# Eye Scan

I read an article about a person at a museum that was looking around, and suddenly saw a picture
floating in the room.  When they looked back, the picture was gone.

It turns out the museum installed a device in the corner of the room that shows a single column 
of colored lights.  The lights rapidly change to show each column of a picture one-at-a-time
going from one side of the picture to the other.  If you look at the device, it just appears to be
a narrow bar of changing lights, but if your eye moves across the device, the complete image gets
projected across the back of your eye.

I was intrigued by this, so I created a simple demo app to demonstrate the effect.  

Hold your phone about a foot from your face, and watch one of the colored dots move back and forth.
Keep you head still and just follow with your eyes.  If you follow the green dot, the image points
to the right.  If you follow the red dot, the image points to the left.
